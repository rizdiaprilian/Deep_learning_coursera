# Deep_learning_coursera

A comprehensive, foundational deep learning course by Andrew NG and DeepLearning.ai. This program will help you understand deep learning concept, and put your knowledge to hands-on practices in building neural network architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTM, and Transformers. Along the way, familiarize yourself with strategies that makes deep learning better: Dropout, Batchnorm, L2 Regularization, and more. 

Additions: Real-world case studies are available for you to learn how impactful deep learning in solving problems, i.e. autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.


Breakdown of this specialization course in brief details:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects

4. Convolutional Neural Networks

5. Sequence Models
